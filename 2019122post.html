            <h1>Boxes Within Boxes</h1>
            <p>The most intimidating aspect of learning code is the number of things you need to know. Before starting anything it’s a
            good idea to know what you’re getting into, even if you can’t have complete knowledge. Just getting the lay of the land
            helps. With coding I’ve learned to look for boundaries within the larger confines of the term “coding”.</p>
            <p>I’ve chosen to focus on front-end development to begin with. That meant becoming familiar with HTML and CSS, neither of
            which are programming languages. HTML is the raw material from which the web is built. CSS dictates what that raw
            material will look like. I find it helps to think of a house. HTML comprises the lumber, sheetrock, nails, screws,
            pipes, wiring, etc. CSS is the blueprint and interior design which configures the raw materials into the finished house.</p>
            <p>Like all analogies this one certainly has flaws, but it lays a foundation (no pun intended) for understanding how HTML
            and CSS work and what can be expected of them. An idea within an idea that gave me a foothold in understanding and
            working with CSS is that every HTML item is enclosed in a box. The easiest way to see this is by adding a border of 1
            pixel (solid red is my go to) to every element on the page.
            </p>
            <p>* { 
            <br>
            border: 1px solid red
            <br>
            }
            </p>
            <p>If you’ve ever used invisible ink you know the feeling when you discover the hidden message on the blank page. That’s
            how I feel when I add this tiny bit of CSS and refresh the page. I can see how the digital 2x4’s and copper pipes are
            currently laid out and if they match the blueprint in my head for the page.</p>
