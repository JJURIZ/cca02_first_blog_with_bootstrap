                    <h1>A Little Advice</h1>
                    <p>Yesterday I spoke with a top notch developer. This was a meeting I’ve been hoping would happen
                        for months.</p>
                    <p>It turns out a gentleman at my gym is developer from way back. He’s written a definitive guide to
                        a particular language,
                        worked at NeXT, and started his own highly successful training organization for current and
                        future developers.</p>
                    <p>I was nervous to say the least.</p>
                    <p>But after the workout was through I sucked it up and introduced myself, explaining that I was
                        diving into the world of
                        software development and asked if he had any tips or recommendations.</p>
                    <p>He had three big ones.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Keep going. Even when you don’t understand it all just keep moving.</li>
                        <li>Everyone, even at his level, encounter challenges. Just that morning he was working on a bit
                            of code to clean up
                            degraded images. He said he didn’t even know where to begin. But he found a thread and
                            started pulling on it. By the end
                            of the day he had the code completed.</li>
                        <li>Get enough sleep.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Anyone that knows me knows the sleep struggles I’ve overcome and how seriously I take my sleep.
                        One item on the list
                        checked off!</p>
                    <p>As for the other two, it was encouraging to hear from someone with so much experience that the
                        trail to competency and
                        eventually mastery is well worn and familiar. There are times when trying to complete an
                        assignment that I feel
                        incapable and that others must be sailing through.</p>
