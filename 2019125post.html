            <h1>Pulling on the Bootstraps</h1>
            <p>I recall listening to a book which briefly described the origin of the phrase “to pull oneself up by your bootstraps”. I
            don’t recall the details but I do remember the original intent; to undertake an impossible task. It is, after all,
            impossible to pull oneself up by their bootstraps. The meaning has switched poles, now indicating something that can be
            done through self-determination and applied effort.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the Bootstrap framework, another phrase comes to mind; “out of the frying pan and into the fire”.
            Creating the original blog site assignment without a framework was difficult yet exhilarating. The end results resemble
            a hand crafted piece, lovable only by the creator. Bootstrap is on it’s way to change this, making the assigned site
            appear polished and clean.</p>
            <p>There is a catch though. Bootstrap isn’t a decal I can throw on to cover up the imperfections. It appears to me to be
            its own universe, a morass of classes to tweak the design and layout of a site. The HTML which seemed so straightforward
            before has become a queue for Bootstrap’s identifiers.</p>
            <p>I’m looking forward to learning about Bootstrap but I wonder how much I’ll capture before moving on to the next topic.
            It seems that rather than learning the material I’m learning where to find the material for later use.</p>
            <p>Is this an impossible task or a lot of effort? I suspect it’s a blend of both. I’ll put in the effort but to “learn”
            Bootstrap, to be familiar with all its classes, seems impossible to me.</p>
